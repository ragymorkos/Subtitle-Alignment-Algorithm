# Subtitle-Alignment-Algorithm
This repository contains tested pseudo-code for a subtitle alignment algorithm I wrote for my independent work project. In general, the algorithm utilizes a chunking mechanism of speech segments in order to align the transcribed text accordingly. Transcribed text could be obtained from any speech-to-text APIs such as Google's Automatic Speech Recognition technology (ASR) and then used with this algorithm in order to create time-coded subtitles for the video or speech segment. Specific details, including the success rate of this approach when compared to YouTube's close captioning functionality, could be found in my attached written final report.
